# Notes

Here you can find Meraki Dashboard API scripts written for Python 3.

**NOTE: These scripts will not run in Python 2. Make sure you are using Python 3 with the appropriate commands for your operating system. You can check your Python version with command "python --version" in Windows and "python3 --version" in Linux/Mac.**

**IMPORTANT NOTE: Some of the older scripts in this repository use the Meraki Dashboard API v0, which is end of life and unsupported. If you are using a script written for v0 and want it converted to v1, please raise an issue about it.**

Check back from time to time, as new scripts are added and existing ones are sometimes polished and improved after initial posting. Please note that since the Meraki APIs are expanded constantly, there may be more efficient ways to complete a task than what was available when these scripts were created. For the latest info on Meraki APIs, visit: https://developer.cisco.com/meraki/whats-new/

# Running scripts locally

To run scripts on your computer locally, you will need to have Python 3 installed, as well as possibly some optional modules, such as the Meraki module, Requests or PyYAML. 
* For the latest version of Python 3, please visit: https://www.python.org/downloads/
* The easiest way to install optional packages is via pip: https://pypi.org/project/pip/
* Although not a requirement, many developers use Python virtual environements to run their scripts: https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html

The opening comments of the scripts contained in this repository will typically include an explanation of the correct syntax to run the script, as well as any required third party modules.

Many scripts support passing your Meraki Dashboard API key via an OS environment variable. The variable name used is `MERAKI_DASHBOARD_API_KEY`. Please refer to documentation of your operating system to configure this. Most scripts provide an alternate way to provide the key as well, such as a config file or a command line argument, in case you prefer not to modify your environment variables.

# Running scripts in the Cisco DevNet Code Exchange development environment

If you run this project using the [Cisco Exchange Dev environment](https://developer.cisco.com/codeexchange/github/repo/meraki/automation-scripts/)

![automation-scripts-exchange-devenv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CiscoDevNet/code-exchange-repo-template/master/manual-sample-repo/img/automation-scripts-exchange-devenv.png)

For some scripts, you can add `Meraki API key` as a parameter.

```
python3 tag_all_ports.py -k <api_key> -t <tag> [-o <org_name>]
        [-n <network_name>] [-f <filter>] [-a <add/remove>]
```

For others set as an environment variable named `MERAKI_DASHBOARD_API_KEY`, `DASHBOARD_API_ORG_ID`, `DASHBOARD_API_SHARD_ID`

For example
```
export DASHBOARD_API_KEY=d03190ff333a3c7feaed89fec5b3b2529f59e8ec
```

You can test these scripts using [Cisco Meraki Always-on sandbox](https://devnetsandbox.cisco.com/RM/Diagram/Index/a9487767-deef-4855-b3e3-880e7f39eadc?diagramType=Topology) with `MERAKI_DASHBOARD_API_KEY`

**checksubnets.py:** This is a script to check if the LAN IPs (management addresses) of all access points in one or more organizations belong to specific IPv4 subnets. The purpose of the script is to find access points with misconfigured management addresses or VLANs, which may cause issues with 802.1x authentications. The output can be displayed on screen or sent as an email report.

**CiscoLive/createWebhookTemplate.py:** Script to create a custom webhook template.

**clientcount.py:** Script to count the total unique client MAC addresses connected to MR access points for an organization during the last month. Can be used as guidance when sizing systems that have per-user licensing, like the Cisco Identity Services Engine.

**cloneprovision.py:** Mass-provisions MX security appliances as individually managed networks, without using templates.

**copymxvlans.py:** This script can be used to export MX VLAN configuration of a source org to a file and import it to a destination org. The script will look for the exact same network names as they were in the source org. Use copynetworks.py and movedevices.py to migrate networks and devices if needed.

**copynetworks.py:** Copies networks and their base attributes from one organization to another. Does not move devices over or copy individual device configuration. Combined networks will be copied as "wireless switch appliance".

**copyswitchcfg.py:** This script can be used to export switchport configuration of a source org to a file and import it to a destination org. The script will look for the exact same network names and device serial numbers, as they were in the source org. Use copynetworks.py and movedevices.py to migrate networks and devices if needed.

**deployappliance.py:** This script claims a single Security Appliance or Teleworker Gateway into an organization, creates a new network for it and binds that network to an existing template.

**deploycustomer.py:** The intent of this script is to automate customer account/organization creation for service providers. The script needs a source organization that will be used for cloning (a "customer template"). This source organization needs to have a network configuration template, which will be used to configure devices. The script will optionally set street addresses for devices, network administration tags, as well as network timezone if provided with a Google Maps API key.

**deploydevices.py:** This script claims multiple devices and licenses into an organization, creates a new network for them and binds that network to an existing template. Initial config, including hostnames and street address/map markers are set for the devices. Will set network timezone to match street address if provided with a Google Maps API key.

**deviceupdownstatus.py:** Hybrid Dashboard API/SNMP script that prints a list of all devices in an organization's inventory, along with their current up/down status. Requires the Requests and PySNMP modules. Supports SNMPv2c and SNMPv3.

**find_clients.py:** Python 3 script that finds all clients with descriptions, MAC addresses or IP addresses including a query string and prints their basic statistics.

**find_ports.py:** This script finds all MS switchports that match the input search parameter, searching either by clients from a file listing MAC addresses (one per line), a specific tag in Dashboard currently applied to ports, or the specific access policy currently configured.

**firmware_lock/firmware_lock.py:** A Python 3 script to lock firmware for devices in an organization to desired builds or release trains. The script works by checking for scheduled firmware updates at defined intervals and delaying any that do not meet the desired criteria by a week if there is less than one week remaining before the update is scheduled to happen.

**getbeacons.py:** This script prints a list of all bluetooth beacons in an organization to terminal/sdtout or a file (Devices which are part of a network are considered in-use).

**get_license_info.py** Prints the license info summary for a specific organization or all organizations an admin has access to.

**googletimezonetest.py:** Example script that gets the time zone that corresponds to a street address by using Google Maps APIs. You can use this code to set network timezones dynamically in your Meraki Dashboard API scripts.

**inventorycsv.py:** Creates a list of all Meraki devices in one or all organizations accessible by an administrator. The primary purpose of the script is to create a CSV file, which can be opened and filtered with a spreadsheet editor, like Excel. The list can also be printed on screen instead.

**invlist.py:** Creates a list of all serial numbers and models of devices that are part of a Meraki network for an organization with a given name. Can print to Stdout or file. See inventorycsv.py for an improved solution for this use case.

**latest_devices.py:** Exports CSV of all in-use devices claimed after a specific date. Can include info for one or more organizations.

**license_counts_csv.py:** Creates a CSV file with aggregated license info for all co-term organizations accessible by an administrator.

**listip.py:** Almost exactly the same as invlist.py, but also prints the "lanIp" of the device. If the device has no "lanIp", it prints "None" for that field instead.

**manageadmins.py:** Add, delete, find and list administrators across organizations.

**merakidevicecounts.py:** Print total device counts per device family for all organizations accessed by your admin account, or a specific subset of organizations, as defined in a simple input file.

**merakilicensealert.py:** Script to send an email alert if the remaining license time in any org an admin has access to is less than X days, or if its license capacity is not sufficient for its current device count. The alert is sent using an SMTP server; by default Gmail. Use an automation platform like Zapier to read this email and trigger further actions. The intent of the script is to get email alerts earlier than 30 days before license expiration.

**mi_bom_tool.py:** Script that counts the numbers and sizes of Meraki Insight licenses needed to cover a set of networks in an organization. The intent is to make assessment of potential upgrade investments easier.

**migrate_cat3k:** Proof of concept script to migrate switchport configuration from Catalyst 3750-X switches to Meraki MS switches. Uses action batches for better scalability.

**migratecomware.py:** Proof of concept script that migrates legacy switch infrastructure based on Comware (HPE A-series) to Meraki MS switches. Comware switch configurations can be provided as files, or by entering the IP address and SSH credentials of the source device. A valid initialization configuration file must be provided, where source devices are mapped to target Meraki serial numbers. Please see migration_init_file.txt in this repository for an example of such a file. This version of the script only supports Comware-based switches and a limited set of Layer 2 switchport commands. The script could be expanded to cover more commands and other CLI-based switch families.

**migration_init_file.txt:** Example init config file for migratecomware.py.

**migrate_devices:** Moves devices from one organization to another.

**migrate_networks:** Copies networks from one organization to another. See script opening comments for list of supported features.

**movedevices.py:** This script that can be used to move all devices from one organization to another. The script will only process devices that are part of a network. The networks of the source org need to exist in the destination org too. Use copynetworks.py if needed to create them.

**mx_firewall_control/mxfirewallcontrol.py:** Script to display, modify and create backups of MX Layer 3 firewall rulesets. Can be used as a command line utility or a backend process for a custom management portal. See also mxfirewallcontrol_manual.pdf and mxfirewallcontrol_example_input_file.txt in this directory.

**mx_firewall_control/mxfirewallcontrol_example_input_file.txt:** Example input file for mxfirewallcontrol.py.

**nodejs_sdk_builder:** Python 3 script that builds a NodeJS SDK for the Meraki Dashboard API by calling the current OpenAPI specification and combining two code template files. 

**offline_logging:** A Python 3 script to log data from the Meraki dashboard to a MongoDB database. Currently focused on logging client activity.

**orgclientscsv.py:** A script to create a CSV file with all of the client devices in an organization. The CSV file will be created in the same folder where this script is located. The script makes no attempt to remove or combine duplicate entries. If you see the same client being reported several times, this is typically an indication of a client that has been moving.

**org_subnets.py:** Prints a list of all subnets configured to MX security appliances as VLANs, static routes or VPN advertisements.

**postman_collection_generator.py:** A script to create a Postman collection for the Meraki Dashboard API v1. The collection is created by fetching the OpenAPI 2.0 specification of a Meraki dashboard organization. Items will created for all endpoints available to that organization, including possible alpha/beta ones.

**privateApplicationsImport.py:** A Python 3 script helps you to import Meraki Secure Connect private applications from a CSV file into your Meraki Dashboard. It automates the process of creating private applications with various configurations.

**provision_sites:** A Python 3 script to provision template-based networks with manually defined VLAN subnets to Meraki dashboard. The script can also claim devices and update their location on the world map.

**reboot.py** A Python 3 script to reboot devices using a list of serial numbers

**RadiusCertSurvey:** MFor Systems Manager Managed devices, it does a survey or every managed devices, and looks at the radius.meraki.com certificates on the device. For a given radius.meraki.com certificate expiration date, it checks to see if devices has the updated cert or does not.

This is important because when the radius.meraki.com cert is renewed, if devices don't have the newest version, there's no full chain of trust on the device, so the device does NOT trust the inividual cert on the device, and, therefore, does not joing the Sentry enabled SSID. Once it falls off the network, there's a lot of work to get it back on.

**removetemplate.py:** This is script to create a copy of a template-based network that preserves as many of the network's settings as possible, while not relying on a configuration template. The initial focus of the script is converting MX appliance networks.

**remoteAccessLogsAnalyzer.py:** This script fetches and analyzes Meraki Secure Connect remote access logs from the Meraki API and generates statistics for selected columns. The results are displayed in a color-coded table, and the data can be saved to a CSV file.

**set_client_tracking.py:** A script to set the client tracking method of a group of networks to a desired value.

**setlocation.py:** Sets the street address and optionally the map marker of all devices in a network or organization. To be more easily clickable, devices will be placed in a spiral around a seed location. There is an option to preserve marker location for MR access points, to avoid breaking wireless map layout.

**setlocation_legacy.py:** Sets the street address of all devices in a given network to a given value. The intent of this script is to quickly fix address misconfigurations on large networks. The script has been updated from its initial version to use the Google Geocoding API to calculate a reasonable new positions for device map markers. This is a legacy script that is preserved as an example of integrating the Meraki Dashboard API with info extracted from a Google API. Please see setlocation.py for an improved version of the script that does not require a Google API key.

**setssidvlanid.py:** Sets the VLAN ID of SSIDs in 'Layer 3 with concentrator' or 'VPN' mode to a value.

**setSwitchPortOnMacOui.py:** This is a script to set attributes of a switch port, if a client with a matching MAC OUI is found connected to it. This script uses two endpoints that were in Beta at time of writing: "List the clients that have used this network in the timespan" and "Action batches". The use case is to provision easily provision switchport settings for IP phones of the same vendor. The script has a protective lock to only attempt to configure ports on MS1xx, MS2xx and MS3xx switches.

**tag_all_ports.py:** Tags all MS switch ports in an organization with a user-defined tag.

**topusers:** Finds bandwidth hoggers in a network through a web UI.

**update_ports.py:** This script finds all MS switchports that match the input search parameter, searching either by clients from a file listing MAC addresses (one per line), a specific tag in Dashboard currently applied to ports, or the specific access policy currently configured. It then changes the configuration of the port by applying the new access policy specified.

**uplink.py:** Iterates through all devices, and exports to two CSV files: one for appliance (MX, Z1, Z3, vMX100) networks to collect WAN uplink information, and the other for all other devices (MR, MS, MC, MV) with local uplink info.
Possible statuses:
- Active: active and working WAN port
- Ready: standby but working WAN port, not the preferred WAN port
- Failed: was working at some point but not anymore
- Not connected: nothing was ever connected, no cable plugged in
- (For load balancing, both WAN links would show active.)

**usagestats.py:** Produces reports on per user group network usage. User groups are identified by subnet, VLAN ID or VLAN name. The script combines the Meraki Dashboard API with a SQLite3 database and sending HTML-formatted emails. See also usagestats_initconfig.txt and usagestats_manual.pdf in this folder.

**usagestats_initconfig.txt:** Example initial configuration file for usagestats.py

**usagestats_manual.pdf:** Manual for usagestats.py


More info about the scripts can be found inline as comments.
