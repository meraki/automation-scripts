If you plan to use Python for SNMP requests pick version 3.5.3. PySNMP will not install easily on Python 3.6

Make sure your "python" and "python/scripts" folders are in %PATH%. For example if installing to "C:\python", edit %PATH% to include:
c:\python
c:\python\scripts

Useful modules (install these):
	Requests: send/receive information to/from REST APIs. To install, run this command: pip install requests
	PySNMP: interact with SNMP devices. To install, run this command: pip install pysnmp
	Meraki: some of the scripts are built to use the Meraki module. To install it run: pip install meraki
	Paramiko: interact with devices using SSH. Used in migration scripts.
		Installation info here: http://www.paramiko.org/installing.html

Visual C++ Build Tools needed to install PyCrypto and PySNMP (v14.0 aka 2015):

You should consider replacing PyCrypto (installed along with PySNMP) with PyCryptodome, which is considered more secure. I haven't tried this yet.
